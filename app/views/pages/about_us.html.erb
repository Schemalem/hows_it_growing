          <h2>Nicole</h2>
          <p>The love Nicole has for plants has exponentially grown as she denies becoming a fully fledged adult. Her <em>fruitful</em> attempts to grow some plants during the 2020 lockdown left her singing ‘Aloe-lujah’. Now a plant parent to many, she’ll never forget the ones that had to leaf due to over <s>watering</s> loving them. Favourite plants are basic and include: sunflowers, aloe vera and a good ol’ fashion aubergine plant 🍆</p>

          <h2>Raz</h2>
          <p>Raz’s favourite motto when it comes to plants is: <em>AH HA HA HA STAYIN’ ALIVE, STAYIN’ ALIVE </em>. To Raz, plants are like distant friends: it’s good to have them, but rarely meet eyes. Thank God for that Aloe Vera that is not fussy: leave it unwaterred for a month, drop it on the floor, chuck it in the corner of the room… <em>“Hey, I’m still here!”</em>. Call it loyalty but when it’s <strong>MINT</strong> to be, it’s <strong>MINT</strong> to be. </p>

          <h2>Mags</h2>
          <p>Even though Mags' motto is <em>survival of the fittest</em>, their collection include almost 100 plants that all live in their small studio. They have an official ban on buying plants, because every flat surface has at least one plant residing there. This doesn't stop Mags from getting new cuttings from friends or bringing home unloved plants found on the sidewalk. Out of the burning building they'd rescue: <strong> rhapidophora tetrasperma, hoya kerrii, senecio rowleyanus</strong>  </p>
